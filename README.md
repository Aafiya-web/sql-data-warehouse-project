🧠 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀
This portfolio project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a modern data warehouse, from raw data ingestion to delivering analytical insights — showcasing my skills in SQL, ETL pipelines, data modeling, and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Framework
The project follows the Medallion Architecture, a layered approach for scalable and maintainable data flow:

Bronze Layer: Raw ERP and CRM data ingested from CSV files into SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Data cleaning, transformation, and normalization to ensure consistency.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled in a star schema for optimized analytics.

📌 Project Scope
Data Integration: Combined ERP and CRM systems into a unified model.

ETL Pipelines: Designed and implemented SQL-based pipelines to transform raw data.

Data Modeling: Created fact and dimension tables based on business logic.

Reporting: Generated SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends.
